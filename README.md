# Estimating Predictability in Human Mobility

This repository contains a library that computes several metrics related to individual human mobility. 


## Usage

To install the library, type:

```
python setup.py install
```

To run the unit tests, type:

```
python -m pytest tests.py
```

## Examples

For examples of how to use each function, please check the file `tests.py`.

## Citation

If you happen to use this library, we would appreciate if you could cite our paper [Deciphering Predictability Limits in Human Mobility](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3347146.3359093) below, which builds upon Song et al.'s work on predictability in human mobility.
